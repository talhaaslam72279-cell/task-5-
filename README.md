I analyzed four network capture (.pcapng) files focusing on core protocols: DNS, HTTP, TCP, and UDP. This repository documents my findings, including detailed traffic summaries (e.g., TCP handshakes, DNS queries) and identifies the specific capture filters (port 53, tcp, http) likely used to segment the traffic. A simple network analysis exercise.
